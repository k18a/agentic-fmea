## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

There are 3 high-risk or critical entries that require immediate attention:

**High Risk Entries:**
- perf_test_005: tool_manipulation (RPN: 216)
- perf_test_006: memory_poisoning (RPN: 343)
- perf_test_013: goal_manipulation (RPN: 210)

### General Recommendations

1. **Implement Continuous Monitoring:** Establish monitoring systems for all failure modes with RPN > 100
2. **Regular Review Cycles:** Schedule quarterly reviews of this FMEA analysis
3. **Incident Response:** Develop incident response procedures for high-risk scenarios
4. **Training:** Ensure team members are trained on identified failure modes and mitigations
5. **Documentation:** Keep this FMEA analysis updated as the system evolves

### Next Steps

1. Prioritize mitigation efforts based on RPN rankings
2. Implement recommended actions for critical and high-risk entries
3. Establish monitoring and detection mechanisms
4. Schedule follow-up assessment in 3 months
5. Update this analysis when system architecture changes
