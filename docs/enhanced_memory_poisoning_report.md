## System Description

An agentic AI email assistant with textual memory implemented using RAG mechanism.
    The system features three-tiered memory (Procedural, Episodic, Semantic) and can autonomously
    process emails with three actions: respond, ignore, notify. The agent has tools to read and write
    memory areas and can make autonomous decisions about what information to memorize.
