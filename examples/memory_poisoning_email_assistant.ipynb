    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated how to use the agentic-fmea library to analyze the memory poisoning attack from Microsoft's whitepaper. The analysis revealed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **High Risk Areas**: Memory retrieval and execution (RPN: 432) poses the highest risk\n",
    "2. **System Vulnerabilities**: Lack of memory validation creates persistent attack vectors\n",
    "3. **Mitigation Strategies**: Input validation, memory access controls, and anomaly detection are critical\n",

    "The FMEA framework provides a structured approach to identifying and prioritizing security risks in agentic AI systems, enabling teams to focus mitigation efforts on the most critical vulnerabilities.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Implement recommended mitigations for high-risk entries\n",
    "2. Establish monitoring systems for memory access patterns\n",
    "3. Conduct regular FMEA reviews as the system evolves\n",
